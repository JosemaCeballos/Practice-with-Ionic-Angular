Whisk or blend until oil and vinegar are well incorporated and no longer separate. Place salmon fillet in a baking dish (I use a small casserole dish). Pour the marinade over the salmon and allow it to marinate for at least 15 minutes (or up to 24 hours covered in the refrigerator).  Turn your oven on high broil. Just before putting the salmon in the oven, drizzle the lemon juice over the fish. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes on the top rack or until salmon is glazed, browned and sizzling.While the salmon is baking, prepare the asparagus.  Wash the asparagus and cut off the bottom inch and a half of each stalk and discard. Spread the asparagus on in a large skillet. Drizzle the grapeseed oil over the asparagus and spread the oil on the asparagus with your hands so that all stalks are completely coated. Sprinkle asparagus with desired amount of salt and pepper. Saute over medium heat for 5 minutes. Add the two tablespoons of vegetable stock and cover the skillet. Saute 4 minutes. Remove lid and add the minced garlic. Place cover back over the asparagus. Continue cooking an additional 3 to 5 minutes until asparagus is cooked but not too soft.  Grate lemon zest over the top of the asparagus."

You can leave the fingerlings whole, and slice lengthwise in half before serving, or halve them and continue roasting (both ways are delicious!) Quarter the fennel and red onion lengthwise, and cut the kabocha into 1/2 inch wedges. Toss all the vegetables in a bowl and drizzle enough olive oil to sufficiently coat. Then, add a big splash of balsamic vinegar (approx. 1/4 cup), a couple hearty pinches of Kosher salt, a few good turns of fresh ground black pepper, and a small sprig of fresh rosemary. Let roast another 30-40 minutes, turning every so often to get an even roast."

            "desc": "Chop your onions, slice your carrots and smash your garlic. Set aside. Peel and chop the potatoes. Set aside in a bowl of cold water. Remove the casing from your chorizo. This is an important step. Chorizo casing is tough and unforgiving and will make the sausage link curl during the cooking process. Just remove it and don't worry about appearance. Cut the links length-wise then chop into half-moons. Sautee in a separate pan until the are nice and browned. Don't put into the pot until the last minute, otherwise the color of the chorizo will leach into the soup turning it a weird red color. Now it's time to prepare the kale. With each individual leaf, cut out the stem. You can do this several ways. Cut a triangle out of the leaf, or fold over the leaf and cut out the stem that way. Or rip off the halves of the leaves off the stem. I like a little bit of stem to give some crunch and texture. Tightly roll the leaf into a bundle. Run your knife over it to julienne the leaf into thin strips. Don't worry if it's not perfect. Set aside the kale. In a big pot, sautee your onions, carrots and garlic in a bit of olive oil. Once the vegetables start to soften, add the potatoes and some crushed red pepper flakes. Stir the pot and cook the potatoes until the outer edges start turning clear. Then add the 6 cups of water and 2 bouillion packets (or 4 cups of broth and 2 cups of water) to the pot. Bring to a boil then let simmer until the potatoes are cooked. With a wooden spoon, mash the potatoes against the side of the pot. Do this until almost all the chunks of potatoes are mashed. Leave some chunks behind. This will give your soup a wonderful hearty texture. Now it's time to add the Kale. It looks like a lot and will fill up your whole pot but not to worry because it wilts down pretty quickly. Cook for 5 minutes at a simmer then stir in chorizo sausage. Serve hot or at room temperature (the latter is my favorite). Eat with a nice crusty loaf of Portuguese bread. Enjoy!"
